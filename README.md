# The risk
Being as this project is very young, there is a great possibility for breaking changes. I will try to minimize 
that as much as possible. I will do the best i can to ensure that all changes take place behind the user's line of sight.
I will try to make that that any changes that would cause problems up front are alerted to developers.

Refer to the Changelog in the wiki.
